## About ChNN
Nowadays artificial neural networks are showing stunning results, but far those neural networks develop, less they look like biological ones. To acheive SOTA results devlopers introduce a lot of knowledge into NN architecture. GPUs training gives a major boost for NNs, but also introduce extra restrictions for NN architecture forcing strickt layering.
