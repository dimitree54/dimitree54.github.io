# About ChNN
Nowadays artificial neural networks show stunning results, but far those neural networks develop, 
 less they look like biological ones. 
To achieve SOTA results developers introduce a lot of knowledge into NN architecture. 
GPUs training gives a major boost for NNs, but also introduce extra restrictions for NN architecture forcing strict layering.

Although I appreciate modern advances at deep learning, 
 in my free time I like to play with simpler NN models. 
In my mind the NN is just a bunch of simple units (neurons) connected with each other and all the complex and useful behaviour should emerge from that units local rules.
